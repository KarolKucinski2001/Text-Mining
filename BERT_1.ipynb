There are many people who visit this site for whom binary vision not only makes sense, but is the correct understanding of salvation history: \"I set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse,\" and so on. In general, I believe they have just as much right to be in the church as I do. My concern is with a system that selects men with binary vision for senior management positions, then wonders why they can't find it in themselves to be more pastoral. If the church regularly promotes men with binary vision, it's no wonder they can't embrace the poor and marginalized with anything but pious bromides in pastoral letters no one reads. - Monica.\n",

When you have business and rich friendly Republicans then that is what happens.  So, the failure was not that the ACA didn't address costs - because indeed it did as much as possible. There were controls on the percent of dollar spent going to share holders.

Nobody should burn green wood & here in Fairbanks, I don't know anyone who is.

The Legislature resolved this year to build 22,500 by 2026 and appropriated $100 million to get the ball rolling.   Where and what kind of units will they be?  If we don’t want them in new suburbs in the countryside they have to be in taller, denser buildings along the rail route.  The only way such developments will work is if rail is completed.

I had friends on both sides of the war; some died, others protested.  SDS was prominent at UofH and Professor Lee was one of its leaders.  I do remember Professor Lee doing a debate with William F. Buckley and that was a mistake for Lee as Buckley was a great debater.  However, the Vietnam War did show that we lost thousands of young people needlessly as the war should have and could have ended a lot sooner.  When politicians are the deciders of our young people's lives, it's always the young people who lose.  More recently, we were told of mass weapons of destruction in Iraq which proved to be a total lie.  I trust people over 40....I just never will trust a politician.\n",

Resources should be moved from the first group to the second.

It is anathema to all other religions and philosophies.

My recollection is that central Canada has always treated the Alberta natural resources with disdain despite the fact that fully 1/3 of Albertans are not from Alberta but rather other parts of the country.  It was a mutually beneficial agreement.  They found jobs and we found workers.   People from the maritimes were able to make a sizeable pay check and maintain a home in their own province due to jobs in the oil industry in Alberta.  Then there was the great social programs in other provinces that were facilitated by a booming oil business in Alberta.  In one province, daycare was $7.00 per day (now $15) with no restrictions on the income of those utilizing the service.  In Alberta, we pay over $900 per month for the same service.\n",

Still, it is an entirely different matter to focus on criminalizing abortion, for many people still follow medieval positions, like St. Thomas Aquinas, that the fetus passes though three stages, vegetive, animal, and human. So they hold a fetus is human only in the last trimester. My option would concentrate less on legal coercion and more on discussion, recognizing the humanness of a fetus, and then exercizing moral discernment when it can morally be aborted--like the Kansas hospital that elected to about the fetus rather than lose the life of both mother and fetus.  A simplistic approach is what we have had for years, with no communication between parties. Demonizing makes devils of us all.\n",

When the parishioners know with whom the priest is sleeping, they can usually rest assured that he is not on the prowl for other liaisons.  While in some countries a common slur might be \"hijo de puta\" or \"son of a whore\", in Peru it more commonly would be \"hijo de cura\" or \"son of a priest\", because that is the equivalent of \"bastard\" being that the biological father is forbidden from marrying his defacto common-law wife. But an honorable priest would be expected to adequately care for his \"wife\" and children, and this reality is tolerated because it is the people or community (sensus fiedelium) who not only support but at times require that a priest have an attachment.

These weren’t acted on in this budget but the continued warnings from Morneau raise business anxieties. It would have been better to get all such measures implemented in the first budget, so the business community knew what kind of business environment they would have to operate in. And now the Trudeau government’s grossly irresponsible refugee policies are threatening to thicken the border between Canada and the US when the Trump regime inevitably responds.
